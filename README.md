# fail2ban-anti-ssh-bruteforce
The fail2ban.md document provides instructions for configuring Fail2ban in ubuntu server to keep SSH password login enabled and protect server from bruteforce login attempts using simple custom jail configuration.  
SSH password login can be secure if proper security practices are followed. However, using SSH key-based authentication is generally considered more secure than password-based authentication.  
It's important to note that while Fail2ban is a useful tool for enhancing server security, it is not a comprehensive solution and should be used as part of a broader security strategy. Regular monitoring, timely security patches, and best practices in network security are crucial for maintaining a secure environment.
